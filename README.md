## Getting Started

To run the Stopwatch application, you need to have Java 8 or later installed on your system and set up a JavaFX development environment.

### Setting up JavaFX

1. Download the JavaFX SDK from the official website: [JavaFX Downloads](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

2. Extract the downloaded archive to a location on your system.

3. Set up the JavaFX environment variable in your development environment:
   - In your project's IDE, go to the project settings or build configurations.
   - Add a new system environment variable named `PATH_TO_FX` and set its value to the path of the extracted JavaFX SDK directory.
   - Apply the changes and save the configuration.

### Building and Running the Application

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

3. Configure the JavaFX runtime:
   - In your project's IDE, go to the project settings or build configurations.
   - Add the JavaFX runtime module to the project dependencies or module path.
   - Specify the JavaFX runtime arguments, such as `--module-path` and `--add-modules`, to include the required JavaFX modules.
   - Apply the changes and save the configuration.

4. Build and run the application:
   - Build the project to compile the source code.
   - Run the project using the specified JavaFX runtime configuration.

## Usage

Once you have launched the Stopwatch application, you can interact with the following buttons:

- **Start**: Begins the stopwatch timer.
- **Stop**: Pauses the stopwatch timer.
- **Reset**: Resets the stopwatch timer to zero.

The elapsed time will be displayed in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm, where:
- HH represents the hours.
- MM represents the minutes.
- SS represents the seconds.
- mmm represents the milliseconds.

## Customize

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the Stopwatch application according to your preference. Here are a few suggestions:

- Modify the color scheme: You can change the background color and text color of the UI elements by modifying the respective CSS properties in the source code.
- Adjust font size: You can adjust the font size of the time label or buttons by modifying the `-fx-font-size` property in the source code.
- Add additional functionality: You can extend the application by adding features such as lap times, lap counters, or export functionality to save the recorded time data.
